A simple fetch tool with less than 100 lines of code.

## About the project
Just a simple fetch tool that I wrote with less than 100 lines. To be honest, I didn't pay attention to the aesthetics and quality of the code. While writing the code, I paid particular attention to the fact that there were no dependencies. Because my goal was to make software that works directly when the repository is cloned, without the need for anything.
